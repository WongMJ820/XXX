# PocketCFO — AI-Powered CFO for Malaysian SMEs

Your neural financial strategist that navigates LHDN e-Invoicing mandates, optimizes cashflow, and makes strategic tax decisions — in real time.

---

## What is PocketCFO?

PocketCFO is an AI-powered financial decision engine built for Malaysian SMEs. It acts as your virtual CFO, analyzing every transaction against LHDN compliance rules and Malaysian tax law to give you instant, actionable recommendations.

**The core loop:**

1. You upload a receipt, invoice, or describe a transaction
2. The PocketCFO Engine (powered by Z.AI GLM-5) interprets, validates, and reasons
3. You get a strategic decision — approved, rejected, or pending — with tax optimization impact

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- A **Z.AI API key** (get one at [ilmu.ai](https://ilmu.ai))
- (Optional) A **Firebase** project for persistent storage — the app works without it using demo data

### Installation

```bash
cd pocketcfo
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Copy the example env file and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Or create a `.env` file in the `pocketcfo/` directory with:

```env
# Z.AI Configuration (server-side only)
ZAI_API_KEY=your-zai-api-key-here
ZAI_BASE_URL=https://api.ilmu.ai/v1

# Firebase Configuration (optional — app works without these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

> **Note:** If you skip Firebase, the app runs in demo mode with mock data. The Z.AI key is required for live AI analysis; without it, the app falls back to a built-in rule-based engine.

### Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Use

### The 3-Panel Interface

The app is divided into three panels:

#### 1. Dashboard (Left Panel)

Your financial command center at a glance:

- **Company Profile** — Your registered SME details and SST ID
- **Compliance Score** — A circular gauge showing your LHDN compliance rate (0–100%). Drops when non-compliant invoices are detected
- **Tax Bracket** — Visual bar showing which tax bracket you're in (15%, 17%, or 24%) and how much chargeable income remains before the next bracket
- **Month-to-Date** — Running totals for revenue, expenses, pending invoices, and liquidity ratio

These numbers update in real time as you submit transactions.

#### 2. Chat (Center Panel)

Talk to your AI CFO directly:

- **Type a message** — Describe a transaction, e.g.:
  - `Receipt from IKEA Damansara for RM7,850`
  - `Invoice from Nasi Kandar Pelita RM485.60, no TIN`
  - `Should I buy a laptop for RM12,500 this month?`
- **Upload a file** — Click the paperclip icon to attach a receipt, invoice, PDF, or spreadsheet (supports images, PDFs, CSVs, and Excel files)
- **Get instant analysis** — The engine responds with compliance status, tax classification, and strategic recommendations

The chat includes a typing indicator and timestamps for every message.

#### 3. Neural Decision Graph (Right Panel)

A visual map of how PocketCFO processes your transactions:

- **Input cards** (left) — Show the documents/receipts fed into the engine
- **Engine node** (center) — The PocketCFO brain with a breathing pulse animation
- **Outcome cards** (right) — Final decisions, color-coded by status:
  - **Green (Approved)** — Transaction is compliant and optimized
  - **Red (Rejected)** — Non-compliant, action required
  - **Amber (Pending)** — Needs more info or deferral recommended

Animated connection lines flow between nodes, with particles traveling along the paths to show data flowing through the engine.

You can scroll, pan, and zoom the graph to explore it.

## What the AI Analyzes

Every transaction goes through the **Decision Intelligence Protocol**:

### Step 1 — Interpret

Extracts key entities: vendor name, amount (RM), SST ID, TIN, date, and category.

### Step 2 — Comply

Checks against LHDN e-Invoice mandate (Version 4.6):
- Is a valid TIN present?
- Are all 55 mandatory fields covered?
- Does the classification match MSIC codes?

### Step 3 — Reason

Compares the expense against your current financial state:
- Does this push expenses past 80% of revenue?
- Does it push you into the next tax bracket?
- Is there a cashflow risk (liquidity < 1.5x)?

### Step 4 — Decide

Generates a strategic action with one of these outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Approved** | Compliant and classified. Proceed. |
| **Rejected** | Non-compliant (e.g., missing TIN). Do not process until fixed. |
| **Pending** | Deferral or reclassification recommended (e.g., delay purchase to next FY). |

## Tax Classification Reference

PocketCFO classifies transactions under Malaysian tax law:

| Classification | Deductibility | Tax Section |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue Expenditure | 100% deductible | Section 33(1), ITA 1967 |
| Capital Allowance | 20% initial + 14% annual | Schedule 3, ITA 1967 |
| Entertainment (50%) | Only 50% deductible | Section 39(1)(l), ITA 1967 |
| SST Exempt | No SST charged | SST Act 2018 |
| Personal | Not deductible | N/A |

### Malaysian Corporate Tax Brackets (SME)

| Chargeable Income | Tax Rate |
|---|---|
| First RM150,000 | 15% |
| RM150,001 – RM600,000 | 17% |
| Above RM600,000 | 24% |

## Example Conversations

**Compliant purchase with TIN:**
```
You: Receipt from IKEA Damansara RM7,850, TIN: C-99887766
Bot: LHDN Compliant — TIN verified. I've classified this RM7,850 purchase
     as Capital Allowance (Schedule 3, Income Tax Act 1967). This qualifies
     for 20% initial + 14% annual rate. Estimated tax savings: RM1,884
     over the asset's useful life.
```

**Non-compliant invoice (missing TIN):**
```
You: Invoice from Nasi Kandar Pelita RM485.60, no TIN
Bot: Warning: This invoice is missing a valid TIN number. Under LHDN
     e-Invoice mandate (effective Aug 2025), all B2B transactions require
     a TIN. Flagged as NON-COMPLIANT. Penalty risk: up to RM5,000.
     Action: Request TIN from the vendor before processing payment.
```

**Tax bracket optimization:**
```
You: Should I buy a Dell laptop for RM12,500?
Bot: Analysis: RM12,500 for laptop. Recommend classifying as Capital
     Allowance under Schedule 3. Initial allowance: RM2,500 (20%).
     If your total chargeable income approaches RM600k, consider
     deferring this to next fiscal year to stay in the 17% bracket.
     Potential savings: RM3,000.
```

## Demo Mode

The app ships with demo data for **Warung Pixel Sdn Bhd** — a fictional Malaysian SME:

- **SST ID:** W10-1234-56789012
- **TIN:** C-12345678
- **Annual Revenue:** RM520,000
- **Current Tax Bracket:** 17%
- **Compliance Score:** 94%

Pre-loaded transactions include an IKEA furniture purchase, a Pelita invoice missing TIN, and a Dell laptop purchase that should be deferred.

If the Z.AI API is unavailable, the built-in rule engine (`engine.ts`) handles these scenarios:
- Compliant transactions with valid TIN
- Non-compliant invoices missing TIN
- Capital expenditure classification
- Recurring expense auto-categorization
- General expense tracking

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Z.AI API key not configured" | Add `ZAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file |
| Chat responses seem generic | The fallback engine is running. Check that your Z.AI key is valid |
| Neural graph lines not showing | Resize the browser window — lines are drawn based on DOM positions |
| Firebase errors in console | Safe to ignore if you're using demo mode. Add Firebase env vars to enable persistence |
| Build fails with EBUSY | Delete the `.next` folder and run `npm run build` again (OneDrive file lock issue) |
